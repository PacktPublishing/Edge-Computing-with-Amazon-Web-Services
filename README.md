**A practical guide to architecting secure edge cloud infrastructure with AWS**

## What is this book about?
The surge in connected edge devices has driven organizations to capitalize on the opportunities presented by the massive amounts of data generated by these devices. However, adapting to this landscape demands significant changes in application architectures.
This book serves as your guide to edge computing fundamentals, shedding light on the constraints and risks inherent in selecting solutions within this domain. Youâ€™ll explore an extensive suite of edge computing services from AWS, gaining insights into when and how to use AWS Outposts, AWS Wavelength, AWS Local Zones, AWS Snow Family, and AWS IoT Greengrass.

This book covers the following exciting features: 
* Overcome network challenges faced at the near and far edge
* Leverage services in over 450 points of presence at the edge of the AWS global backbone
* Deploy edge solutions in disconnected scenarios using AWS Snow Family
* Build multi-access edge (MEC) solutions with 5G and AWS Wavelength
* Configure AWS Snowcone as an IIoT gateway with AWS IoT Greengrass
* Extend your AWS VPC into your on-premise data center with AWS Outposts
